                                <p> If authenticity is the name of the game, then <b>Sushi Bai Kiyoshi</b> is the place. Located at the north end of Simcoe Street in the financial district of downtown Toronto, it has quickly become a favorite of the business crowd, students from Osgood and even some who make the trek down University Avenue from Queens Park for take-out lunch. </p>

                                <blockquote>

                                <p> The overall quality and variety of sushi is above what you would expect a takeout place to be and the prices, although higher than most take-outs, are quite reasonable considering the care that Chef Kenshin Kiyoshi puts into each order. Not only can you get excellent quality, freshly-made sushi (try the chirashi), but you can also stretch your budget by picking up a selection of their always available pre-made sushi and maki sets (discounted by 25% at the end of the business day). </p>

                                <p>Service is always quick and friendly; the staff consists solely of Kiyoshi’s wife and three adult children who all share his passion for delivering high quality, authentic sushi at a fair price. Kiyoshi’s approach is to use the freshest possible ingredients, and sell at a high volume during the lunchtime, which typically spans from shortly after 11:00 AM to about 2:00 PM. </p>

                                <p>It is this approach that drove him to look at a take-out only restaurant, not wasting any overhead on dine-in. The take-out counter starts to really heat up around 12:30 PM with lines typically extending out the door and down Simcoe. The shop is only open Monday to Friday due to its location and typically closes by 8:00 PM after a few hours of relatively brisk business from walk-ins, for pre-made sets, as folks head home for the day.</p>
